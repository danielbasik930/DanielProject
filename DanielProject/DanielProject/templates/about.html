    <h2 class="heb">about the project</h2>
    <p>
        The project is part of the "Data science" profession of the students of the 10th graders at the Alterman school in Tel Aviv.
        Because of the corona virus a lot of this work we did from home, and we called the teachers remotely in the zoom.
        It was challenging because it was different but also a bit of fun.
